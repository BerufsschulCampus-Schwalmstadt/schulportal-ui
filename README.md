# Web tools for SPHplanner

### [Debug Log Reader](https://koenidv.github.io/sph-planner/debugger)

SPHplanner can generate a log file with a user's actions within a session, as well as a logcat dump without a need for adb (starting v132). The log is formatted as json, this simple reader allows for a quick overview.

Simply paste the debug log, a link to it on [dogbin](https//del.dog) or its dogbin slug in the input field. If you allow clipboard access, the site will try to get these values from your clipboard on page load.
